Tubifarry is a plugin for **Lidarr** that fetches metadata from **Spotify** and **YouTube**, enabling direct music downloads from YouTube. Built on the foundation of trevTV's projects, it leverages the YouTube API for seamless integration. üõ†Ô∏è  

Additionally, Tubifarry supports fetching soundtracks from **Sonarr** (series) and **Radarr** (movies) and adding them to Lidarr using the **Arr-Soundtracks** import list feature. This allows you to easily manage and download soundtracks for your favorite movies and TV shows. üé¨üéµ

### Fetching Soundtracks from Sonarr and Radarr üé¨üéµ  
Tubifarry also supports fetching soundtracks from **Sonarr** (for TV series) and **Radarr** (for movies) and adding them to Lidarr using the **Arr-Soundtracks** import list feature. This allows you to easily manage and download soundtracks for your favorite movies and TV shows.  

To enable this feature:  
1. **Set Up the Import List**:  
   - Navigate to `Settings -> Import Lists` in Lidarr.  
   - Add a new import list and select the option for **Arr-Soundtracks**.  
   - Configure the settings to match your Sonarr and Radarr instances.  
   - Provide a cache path to store responses from MusicBrainz for faster lookups.  

2. **Enjoy Soundtracks**:  
   - Once configured, Tubifarry will automatically fetch soundtracks from your Sonarr and Radarr libraries and add them to Lidarr for download and management.

### Optional: FFmpeg and Audio Quality üéß  
1. **FFmpeg**: FFmpeg can be used to extract audio from downloaded files, which are typically embedded in MP4 containers. If you choose to use FFmpeg, ensure it is installed and accessible in your system's PATH or the specified FFmpeg path. If not, the plugin does attempt to download it automatically during setup. Without FFmpeg, songs will be downloaded in their original format, which may not require additional processing.  

   **Important Note**: If FFmpeg is not used, Lidarr may incorrectly interpret the MP4 container as corrupt. While FFmpeg usage is **recommended**, it is not strictly necessary. However, to avoid potential issues, you can choose to extract audio without re-encoding, but this may lead to better compatibility with Lidarr.

2. **Max Audio Quality**: Tubifarry supports a maximum audio quality of **256kb/s AAC** for downloaded files through YouTube. While most files are in 128kbps AAC by default, they can be converted to higher-quality formats like **AAC, Opus or MP3v2** if FFmpeg is used.  

   **What is AAC?**  
   AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) is a high-quality audio format that offers better sound quality than MP3 at similar bitrates. It is commonly used in MP4 containers, making it a versatile and widely supported format.  

   **Note**: For higher-quality audio (e.g., 256kb/s), you need a **YouTube Premium subscription**.

### Troubleshooting üõ†Ô∏è  
- **Optional: FFmpeg Issues**: If you choose to use FFmpeg and songs fail to process, verify that FFmpeg is correctly installed and accessible in your system's PATH. If not, try reinstalling or downloading it manually.  
- **Metadata Issues**: If metadata is not being added to downloaded files, confirm that the files are in a supported format. If using FFmpeg, ensure it is extracting audio to formats like AAC embedded in MP4 containers (check debug logs).  
- **No Release Found**: If no release is found, YouTube might flag the plugin as a bot (which it technically is). To avoid this and access higher-quality audio, you can log in using cookies.  
  - **Steps to Use Cookies**:  
    1. Install the **cookies.txt** extension for your browser:  
       - [Get cookies.txt for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc)  
       - [Get cookies.txt for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/)  
    2. Log in to YouTube and save the cookies.txt file in a folder accessible by Lidarr.  
    3. Go to the **Indexer and Downloader** settings in Lidarr and add the file path to the cookies.txt file.
