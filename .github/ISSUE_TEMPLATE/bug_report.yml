        ## Logs
        
        To help resolve your issue, trace logs are needed. Please follow these steps:
        
        1. **Enable trace logging** and replicate the problem you encountered
        2. Guidance on how to enable trace logging can be found in the troubleshooting guide of Lidarr
        3. Please paste your logs directly in the plaintext section below
        4. Use the details tag to keep the issue readable or attach the logs as a file
